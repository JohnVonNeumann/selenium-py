# selenium-py

Learning Selenium to help improve my test automation skills. Using Python instead of Java to improve Py skills whilst I'm at it.

* Been spending some time getting Firepath setup for using xpath, strange how they bundle the thing into firefox but then they don't support some basic addon functionality. Had to go back to firebug vxx.18 in order to get the xpath stuff working. Even then, might have to port back further seeing as the course i'm only recommended much older than .18

* Now have webdrivers running for Chrome and Firefox, I'll build tests for those two. Anything more than that I can learn on the job when I come across them.
