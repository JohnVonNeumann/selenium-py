# selenium-py

Learning Selenium to help improve my test automation skills. Using Python instead of Java to improve Py skills whilst I'm at it.

> The best working example I have is the FindByIdName script. I am updating it with more and more advanced stuff as I go. 

* Been spending some time getting Firepath setup for using xpath, strange how they bundle the thing into firefox but then they don't support some basic addon functionality. Had to go back to firebug vxx.18 in order to get the xpath stuff working. Even then, might have to port back further seeing as the course i'm only recommended much older than .18

* Now have webdrivers running for Chrome and Firefox, I'll build tests for those two. Anything more than that I can learn on the job when I come across them.

* Created my first gitignore file with this project, was containing log files that weren't required to be publicly viewable.

* After completing two different tutorials on finding by name, id, xpath and whatnot. I've decided that I have enough of a fundamental understanding and have decided to move on with what I'm working on. I'm now on logging of test results which is interesting. I have made the choice to continue on with more advanced topics as I need to get upto scratch on this topic quickly and not just continue with easy stuff. I won't improve at the rate I need to.

* Been doing some reading and install of the Selenium IDE, I'm trying to suss if it's better to use that over writing the tests. I would assume that it's probably better to write them yourself unless you were previously a manual tester who did point and click type stuff. For my purposes, I'll just stick to writing.
